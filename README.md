# HopsToIt

HopsToIt is a demo of the [AskDOM](https://github.com/aschneit/AskDom) DOM manipulation library. It queries the [Punk API](https://punkapi.com/) for craft beers matching a user's search criteria. A majority of the methods in the AskDOM are used in building the site's structure, form and form actions, event handlers, and API queries.
